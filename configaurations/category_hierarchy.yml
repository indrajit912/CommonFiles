# 2. Category Naming:
#    - Use descriptive and meaningful names for categories to ensure clarity.
#    - Avoid using special characters or spaces in category names.
#    - Choose a short 'code' for any category. Preferably 4-5 char long!

# 3. Descriptions:
#    - The 'description' field should provide a concise overview of the category's content or subject matter.

# 4. Indentation:
#    - Use proper indentation (2 spaces) to maintain the hierarchy. Be consistent throughout the file.

# 5. Editing Guidelines:
#    - Feel free to add, modify, or remove categories and subcategories as needed.
#    - Ensure that child categories are properly nested under their parent categories.
